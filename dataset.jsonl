{"label":"Healthy Eating and Junk Food","prompt": "What is junk food? How much and how often junk food can be allowed for a child in a week?", "response": "Junk food comprises of foods high in dietary fats, sugar, salt, or those which are nutritionally inappropriate. Most of the ultra-processed foods (foods that are commercially prepared by mixing several ingredients and adding additives such as sugars, flavors, and colors) are junk foods as either they are nutritionally poor or high in sugar, salt, or fat. Sugar-sweetened beverages, carbonated drinks, and caffeine-containing drinks are also categorized as unhealthy foods under the broad acronym JUNCS (Junk foods, Ultra-processed foods, Nutritionally inappropriate foods, Caffeinated/colored/carbonated  foods/bever ages, and Sugar-sweetened beverages). Table 1 lists the common junk foods. Children and adolescents should avoid consumption of foods and beverages categorized as JUNCS, as far as possible. Alternatively, limit consumption of these foods at home/outside to not more than one serving per week; serving not exceeding 50% of total daily calorie requirement for that age. "}
{"label":"Healthy Eating and Junk Food","prompt": "What are the commonly consumed junk foods?", "response": "Ultra-processed food : Packaged breakfast cereals, ready breads, instant noodles, commercial ice creams and flavored yoghurts, margarine, milk supplements, packaged snacks and chips.Restaurant food Pizzas, burgers, French fries, noodles, pastas.Beverages : Carbonated drinks, fruit drinks (packaged juices with added sugar), flavored drinks, energy drinks, sugar sweetened beverages"}
{"label":"Healthy Eating and Junk Food","prompt": "As working parents, we are dependent on breads, cornflakes, etc. Are they healthy?", "response": "Many parents look for quick solutions to feeding the children, especially when both are working. Most of the ready-to-eat foods are not as healthy as they are often claimed to be. Some of the examples to explain this fact are as follows: Cornflakes have a low-fat content, but the sugar, flavor, and corn syrup added to the flakes make it an unhealthy choice. Cornflakes are made up of malt, fructose corn syrup, and sugar, which make them very high in refined sugars. Corn syrup used in corn flakes has been found to have high levels of fructose in them. They might be low in fat but the sugar content promotes fat storage. Similarly, bread is relatively low in essential nutrients. It is rather high in calories and carbs but low in protein, fat, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Its excessive intake, especially white bread containing simple carbohydrates, can lead to unwarranted weight gain and predisposition to chronic ailments such as diabetes and heart disease. Even most brown breads predominantly have refined flour and are processed in same way as white bread."}
{"label":"Healthy Eating and Junk Food","prompt": "How is junk food harmful to body?", "response": "Junk food can be harmful in many ways; some problems may appear early and others in due course of time. Most of these foods have poor nutritional quality due to high carbohydrate and fat content. Mostly they are high in sugar or salt as well. On the contrary, they are low in proteins, vitamins, minerals, and other micronutrients. This nutritionally imbalanced diet often leads to rapid weight gain and obesity. As the intake continues over a longer duration, it may affect the lipid profile of the body thereby predisposing to more severe illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. Some of the additives used in ultra-processed foods may also increase the risk of cancer. Microbial contamination due to poor hygiene can lead to gastrointestinal infections such as diarrhea, typhoid, and hepatitis. High sugar content of junk foods and drinks may lead to dental caries. Food additives and coloring agents may cause allergies. Caffeinated drinks cause increase in the heart rate and sometimes abnormal rhythm of heartbeat. Regular over consumption of caffeinated drinks may cause psychiatric and sleep disturbances."}
{"label":"Healthy Eating and Junk Food","prompt": "What are healthy food options for babies,  toddlers, and young children? ", "response": "All babies till 6 months of age should be exclusively breastfed. Any sorts of ghutti, water, top milk, honey, juices, or tea are not permitted.Beyond 6 months, some common homemade food options are providedFor infants 6 months to 1 year: Khichri, dalia, sooji kheer, mashed potatoes/banana/boiled vegetables, upma, mashed idli, and curdFor toddlers and children: Dal, rice, chapatti, vegetables, curd, chilla (dal and besan), egg, fruits, idli-dosa with homemade batter, upma/seviyaan/poha (with vegetables), milk fruit smoothies without sugar, cooked beans, and roasted/boiled chicken/fishThese are just some of the examples. Fresh homemade foods, low in sugar, salt and saturated fats, and high in proteins should be preferred."}
{"label":"Healthy Eating and Junk Food","prompt": "What should be the energy intake from various types of foods?", "response": "Total calories in a healthy meal should be divided as 15-30% from fats, 10-5% from proteins, and 55-75% from carbohydrates. Free sugars should be <5% and there should not be any trans fat. Recommended salt intake up to 12 months is <1 g salt, 1-3 years <2 g, 4-6 years <3 g, 7-10 years <5 g, and for ≥11 years 6 g per day. "}
{"label":"Healthy Eating and Junk Food","prompt": "My baby likes juices and shakes. Are they healthy and how much can I give?", "response": "Pre-packaged juices and shakes are not healthy foods to be offered to children. Regarding juices, it is always better to give whole fruit rather than fruit juice. Eating whole fruit has advantages, including more fiber content, more nutrient content, and lesser chances of microbial contamination, which can happen while extracting juices. Regarding how much juice to give, the recommendations are: Fruit juices should not be offered to children less than 2 years.For children 2-5 years, up to 125 mL of only fresh homemade fruit juices with no added sugars can be given, per day. In children older than 5 years, the amount can be increased till 250 mL per day, but it should be fresh, homemade, and without added sugars. Canned and packaged fruit juices are not advisable. For milk-shakes, whole fruit mashed with milk at home without any added sugar can be given but milkshake powders or juice extracts should not be used. The best beverage to offer any child is clean pure water. "}
{"label":"Healthy Eating and Junk Food","prompt": "I have started adding milk supplements to my toddler's milk. I heard that they give lot of energy, vitamins, and minerals. Is this true? What is the right age to give them?", "response": " Malt-based milk supplements are very commonly used in India. While the primary ingredient is malt, mostly barley, or cereal derivative, the secondary ingredient is invariably high content of sugar. It is the free sugar which becomes a matter of concern for us. It is not only addictive but leads to all associated problems such as weight gain, dental caries, and risk for chronic lifestylerelated ailments. Milk supplements belong to ultra-processed food category and should best be avoided. Advertising has often portrayed the supplements as full of energy, vitamins, and minerals. The quantities of micronutrients present in these drinks may give some benefit to children who have their deficiency, but have no role in healthy kids. Even for providing the vitamins and minerals, the same amount can easily be obtained from other foods which are not only cheaper but also do not have associated ill effects as with these drinks. Results of improved calcium clearly indicate that it is just the milk that was responsible for it."}
{"label":"Healthy Eating and Junk Food","prompt": "We prepare all sorts of delicacies such as pizza, burger, samosa, and kulfi at home. Are they still junk food? Are traditional foods such as halwa, poori, and sewaiyaan also junk food? ", "response": "Any food which is high in fat content, especially saturated fat and trans fats (produced from chemical process of hydrogenation of vegetable oil), sugars, and salts is considered as junk food. These foods are high in calorie and fats, and low in nutritional value. However, these are still better than similar foods available in market as there are no colors, preservatives, and taste enhancers in home-cooked food, and children tend to eat them in limited quantity as against ultra-processed foods which are usually consumed in higher quantity due to their taste, color, and flavor. Home-made foods can be made slightly healthier by following modifications:  Maintain hygiene to decrease chances of microbial contamination, so less risk of infections.Avoid reuse of pre-heated and used oil.Restrict sugar and salt content.Less refined products can be used like whole wheat flour instead of maida and jaggery instead of refined sugar. Avoid using preservatives and colors"}
{"label":"Healthy Eating and Junk Food","prompt": "Which oil should be used to cook food? Is it good to prepare food in desi ghee and butter?", "response": "You can use the same oil which is being used to cook food for other family members. No single oil/fat has an ideal composition, and hence a frequent change of oils between groundnut oil, mustard oil, and soyabean oil is preferred. Some people also use olive oil. If we are using the same used oil repeatedly for cooking, it increases the component of trans fat which is unhealthy and very harmful for the body. Thus, reusing the oil that has been earlier used for frying should be avoided.Yes, we can use a bit of desi ghee or butter in preparing food to make it healthy and palatable but we should keep the fact in mind that per day saturated fat should constitute <10% of total energy intake. "}
{"label":"Healthy Eating and Junk Food","prompt": "My child is not ready to eat home food.  What should I do?", "response": "his is a common problem that many parents face. In first place, we should try to avoid initial introduction of junk food so that children do not get addicted to their taste and flavor, thereby decreasing dependency on these foods. For parents whose children have already crossed this stage, and are now fussy eaters to healthy food, the following tips may be used to overcome their dependency: Stay calm, do not get angry or shout.Do not try force feeding.Keep healthy food around; do not get junk food at home.Be a role model. Children are silent observers; they will follow what you do.Start with introduction of just one healthy food at one time. Introduce in a cheerful way.Make taste and appearance modifications in healthy foods.Avoid intermittent snacking. Involve child in preparing and serving meal or snack. "}
{"label":"Healthy Eating and Junk Food","prompt": "My 14-year-old son takes lot of tea and coffee (four to five cups per day), especially during examination time to stay awake but still feels sleepy. Some of his friends have suggested some energy drinks for the same but I am very apprehensive about it. Please guide me what is right for him.", "response": "Tea, coffee, and energy drinks are basically caffeine-containing drinks. Often children tend to take these drinks to stay awake and feel more energetic. However, excessive caffeine intake can lead to serious consequences such as increase in heart rate or abnormal rhythm of heart beats. It may also lead to other disturbances such as poor sleep, restlessness, anxiety, depression, and tremors. No caffeinated or carbonated drink should be consumed by children <5-yearold. In school-going children and adolescents, tea/coffee intake should be limited to maximum of half cup/day (100 mL) and in 10–18 years one cup/day (200 mL), provided no other caffeinated products (cola and chocolates) are being consumed. Caffeinated energy drinks are as strict no for all children and adolescents. "}
{"label":"Normal Sleep and Physical Activity","prompt": "Why is sleep important for my child? What are sleep stages?", "response": "Sleep is an essential, active, and dynamic physiologic process that has a critical impact on health, development, and daytime function. During sleep, our body conserves energy, restores its normal processes, and promotes physical growth and development. Sleep improves mood and is important for optimal functioning. The two stages of sleep include rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep, and these alternate multiple times through the night with increasingly longer and deeper REM periods occurring toward morning. Cultural and genetic factors are responsible for variations in sleep behavior but not in sleep requirements. "}
{"label":"Normal Sleep and Physical Activity","prompt": "How much sleep should children get at different ages?  What happens if my child does not get enough sleep?", "response": "As children grow, sleep needs change considerably. Newborns have a fragmented awake-sleep pattern and require the greatest total sleep time. Sleep times gradually decrease from infancy to adolescent. Adequate sleep duration is necessary for optimal daily function and good health Insufficient sleep leads to poor health. Adverse effects include daytime sleepiness, irritability, behavioral problems, learning difficulties, poor academic performances, and increased likelihood traffic accidents in young people.

{"label":"Normal Sleep and Physical Activity","prompt": " Could you kindly give me some tips to help my child sleep better?", "response": " Establishing good sleep hygiene means developing habits that help children to get good sleep. Behavioral sleep problems are caused by continuing and reinforcing bad habits over years. Obeying the body clock: Sleeping at the same time every night helps your child’s body remember to feel sleepy. During holidays, the difference in sleep time should not be more than an hour. Improving the sleep environment: If possible, have a separate room/area for sleep, a quiet environment, with dimmed lighting and a comfortable room temperature to improve the child’s ability to sleep well. The child’s bed must be comfortable and feel safe and away from TV/computers/digital devices."}
{"label":"Normal Sleep and Physical Activity","prompt": " Establishing a Sleep Routine", "response": "Set-up the same routine to allow the child to get into a habit. This could include: Avoiding TV/computer/video games  1 hour before sleep time Read/tell a bed-time story to the child If you cannot control noise, try using a pair of earplugs Taking a warm bath Avoiding chocolate, caffeinated, or sugary drinks at bedtime and replacing them with warm milk. "}
{"label":"Normal Sleep and Physical Activity","prompt": "Promoting Sleep Settling in Babies", "response": "Babies need to settle to sleep by themselves and parents can help. 0–6 months: The baby can be held in arms until they fall asleep. When putting down in cot, caregiver may use a soothing voice or gentle stroking. Second option is to place baby in cot when calm and drowsy and gently stroke till they fall asleep comforting them with soft sounds. 6 months to 2 years: Controlled comforting— mother leaves the baby before he is asleep and waits outside the room. She comes back if the baby cries after a brief time  (2–4 minutes) and talks to or pats child without picking him/her up and again leaves as soon as child is quiet and before he/she falls asleep."}
{"label":"Normal Sleep and Physical Activity","prompt": "What is safe sleeping and  why is it important? ", "response": "Safe Sleeping Practices  All babies should be put to sleep on their backs but let them find their own sleep position, if they roll over during the night. Back to sleep is the safest position for healthy babies.  Promoting breastfeeding reduces the risk of SUDI by more than half. Regardless of whether your baby is breastfed or not, please follow safe- sleeping practices.  Room sharing but not bed sharing with parents or siblings for first 6–12months  Use a separate sleep space (cot) with a firm surface, tight-fitting bedsheet, and no soft pillows or stuffed toys.  Swaddling the baby is fine. Keep baby’s head and face uncovered.  Discourage smoking as exposure to second-hand smoke harms babies. Smoking is linked to SUDI even when parents smoke away from their infants. Sudden unexplained death in infancy (SUDI) is the term used when an infant dies unexpectedly and an obvious cause is not identified. Research has shown that chances of SUDI are reduced, if safe sleeping practices are used for infants. "}

{"label":"Normal Sleep and Physical Activity","prompt": "What are behavioral sleep problems?What strategies can I use to prevent or manage them?", "response": "Common Types Difficulty getting to sleep or waking multiple times at night: Sleep-onset association disorder: Falls asleep readily, if person (parent) or object (TV) is there. In the absence of the parent or object, child struggles to get to sleep. Typically, wakes 1–4 times per night, again wanting parent there or TV turned back on in order to resettle to sleep  Limit-setting disorder: Child comes in and out of the room multiple times before falling asleep. Multiple requests to parents (“I want a drink, I want to go to the toilet, I want to talk to you, I am scared...”) to avoid/delay going to bed. Parents find it difficult to set limits around these behaviors, known as “curtain calls”. Management Strategies For sleep-onset association disorder, you can use either of two methods described here: 1. Checking method: You settle your child, leave the room for 1–2 minutes, and promise to return after this time. Gradually, increase the time spent outside the child’s room. Eventually, you return to find that your child has fallen asleep.2. Camping out method: Place a bed or chair next to the child’s bed. For the first few nights, you pat child to sleep. After a few nights, sit next to bed/ cot but do not touch the child. Gradually, move the chair/bed away from child over a period of 7–10 nights. When the child wakes overnight, you must return to the bedroom and sit on the chair/bed until the child falls asleep again. For limit-setting disorder: Limit child to 1–2 requests at the start of the night. The use of the “bed-time pass” method can help this. The child gets one pass to use during the night and after this is used up,  he/she needs to stay in the room and go to sleep. "}
{"label":"Normal Sleep and Physical Activity","prompt": "At times, my child screams at night, or walks or talks in his sleep. Should I be worried? ", "response": " Day-time stressful events, watching horror movies, or reading books that maybe scary can turn dreams into nightmares. Children need reassurance that nightmares are not real and cannot harm them. Using a night light, avoiding scary movies or talking to someone about it will help. Sleepwalking or somnambulism: These episodes occur during deep sleep (NREM stage) often in the initial part of the night. Sleepwalkers may keep eyes open, appear clumsy, and are unresponsive to environment. It can be unsafe, as child may calmly go outside through an open door without being aware. Sleep-talking or somniloquy is common. It may be seen in children with fever, sleep deprivation, and stress and also in adolescents who have substance abuse problems. This will subside on its own with good sleep hygiene.  These behaviors are known as parasomnias or disruptive sleep disorders. Parasomnias occur when child is falling asleep, sleeping, or waking up. Although the behaviors may appear complex and purposeful to others, the child remains asleep and often has no memory of them. Most children outgrow them and only reassurance is needed. Children who sleepwalk may also have night terrors or sleepwalk. Night terrors: These usually occur 2 or 3 hours after a child falls asleep, when sleep moves from the deepest stage of sleep to lighter REM sleep. They may be dramatic but child does not remember the episode and after a few minutes, child calms down and returns to sleep. Nightmares: These are bad dreams, which usually occur later in the night during the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage. They wake the child who may remember content of dream"}
{"label":"Normal Sleep and Physical Activity","prompt": "What is sedentary behavior? How much sedentary behavior is OK for children?", "response": " Sedentary behavior includes sitting and lying down but not sleeping. Very little energy is spent and children may be sedentary at school or home. Quality sedentary behaviors, such as storytelling, reading, and solving puzzles, support healthier growth and development. <2 years of age: Child should not be using electronic media. 2–5 years: Sitting and watching TV/iPad to be limited <1 hour/ day. <5 years: Child to be active and not sedentary for >1 hour at a time unless asleep. 5–17 years: Minimize sedentary time. Avoid long periods of sitting. Use of electronic items, iPad, TV, computers, etc. for entertainment to be limited to a maximum of 2 hours a day. "}
{"label":"Normal Sleep and Physical Activity","prompt": "What are the benefits of physical activity to my child’s health?", "response": " It helps children to have a fit and healthy life with good physical and mental well-being. Children will develop healthy heart and lungs, bones, muscles, and joints. Children will develop muscle strength, coordination, and control. A healthy body weight is maintained. Body will become more flexible and their balance and posture will improve. Brain will develop vital connections, leading to improved concentration and thinking skills. It reduces chance of getting chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Exercise enhances development of motor, cognitive, and social skills and sleep is better. Physical activities improve cognitive functioning, memory, and academic achievements. The psychological advantages include improved mood, better outlook, positive self-esteem, team cooperation, and a good life. It helps overcome depression, develop discipline as well as good social and emotional wellbeing."}
{"label":"Normal Sleep and Physical Activity","prompt": "What is the recommended time and types of physical activities for my child according to age", "response": "Children need to be as active as possible all day in a safe and supervised environment. All moments of physical activity count—the more the better. 9 Birth to 1 year: At least supervised 30 minutes of tummy time when awake Activities: Reaching, grasping, pulling, pushing, moving their head, body, and limbs, and crawling 1–2 years: At least 3 hours (180 minutes) 3–5 years: At least 3 hours (180 minutes) with at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity Light activity includes standing up, moving around, rolling, and playing Moderate-to-vigorous activity includes skipping, hopping, dancing, running, jumping, climbing a frame, chasing games and ball games in group play, and swimming. 5–18 years: 3 hours of structured physical activity Children can participate in aerobic exercises and exercises to strengthen the muscles and bones At least 1 hour of moderate intensity physical activity is recommended.

{"label":"Normal Sleep and Physical Activity","prompt": "How can children with autism, cerebral palsy, or chronic diseases,  such as diabetes, participate in physical activities?", "response": "There is no specific physical activity for different problems. Find out what the child enjoys and encourage participation as able in physical activities of their choice. This positive therapeutic intervention enables children to be happier, healthier, and they become more resilient. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) : Physical activity helps to  improve the concentration of children with ADHD. Children could be allowed to have time in-between classes to move. Gradually with improvement in concentration, complex exercises such as martial arts (karate and judo), yoga, dancing, gymnastics, weight training, and rock climbingcan be practiced. These improve balance, timing, memory, and concentration.Autism Spectrum Disorder :It is important to identify the child’s interest and encourage participation in preferred activities so that child has fun and learns to play with children of similar age. Exercises such as bear crawls, medicine ball slams, star jumps, arm circles, and mirror exercises have been found to be useful.Cerebral Palsy : Encourage replacing sedentary behavior with light physical activity and as much moderate-to-vigorous exercise as possible. Children should have fun and participate with family and friends, e.g., wheelchair sports, adaptive bikes, hydrotherapy, or swimming. Those with severe disability can try transitioning from seated position to standing using standing frames. They can gain functional improvements with training and encouragement. Diabetes Mellitus : Exercise makes insulin work better in the body and allows children to keep their blood sugars in a healthier range. Exercise burns calories and builds muscle, which allows body to burn more calories. For type 1 diabetes, it is important to modify the insulin regimen and carbohydrate intake to prevent exerciserelated hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels). This is as per advice of your doctor. For type 2 diabetes, there should be same physical activity goals as for all children. It is difficult to describe all conditions here, where sleep is affected. Please consult your pediatrician for other situations. "}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "Are baby teeth important, as they fall anyways?", "response": "Primary/milk teeth/baby teeth give shape to your child’s face and help to guide permanent teeth into the right position. They are crucial for learning to eat and to speak. Thus, it is important to care for them. Protecting baby teeth is important as they are around for 12 years and not just as tools for chewing. Healthy baby teeth are also important for language development, jaw growth, and coordination of the musculature as they are for esthetics and therefore for your child’s self-esteem. "}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "How does tooth decay occur in milk teeth?", "response": "Primary teeth have a thinner outer enamel (a thin, hard, and white substance that covers the tooth) than permanent teeth. This puts them at risk for early childhood tooth decay, which can begin even before the first tooth appears. Causes Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing Decay is caused by bacteria and happens more easily if teeth keep coming into contact with sweet liquids—such as formula, milk, juice, shakes and ice-creams, and are not cleaned regularly. Early childhood tooth decay can affect your child’s health and cause pain,making it hard for your child to sleep, eat, or speak. It can also affect your child’s ability to concentrate and learn. Children who develop dental decay at an early age are more likely to suffer from it throughout childhood. How to identify? Early signs of caries can be seen as white spots on the teeth that appear first. Then, an early cavity appears that has a light brown color on the tooth. The tooth color progressively becomes darker and a hole (cavitation) may appear. Symptoms such as sensitivity to sweets and cold beverages or food may occur."}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "How can we prevent dental cavities?", "response": "Cavities happen when bacteria and food left on the teeth after eating are not brushed away. Acid collects on a tooth, softening its enamel until a hole or cavity forms. Here is how to keep cavities away: Start good oral habits early. Teach kids to brush at least twice a day (after eating) and to floss regularly. Limit or avoid some foods. Sugary foods, juices, candy (especially sticky gummy candy, gummy vitamins, or fruit leather or “roll-ups”) can erode enamel and cause cavities. It is best to avoid them. If your kids eat these foods, have them rinse their mouth or brush their teeth after eating to wash away the sugar. The same goes for taking sweetened liquid medicines: always have kids rinse or brush afterward."}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "When should dental care begin and why early childhood dental visits are important?", "response": " Regular dental care should begin by 1 year of age, with a dental check-up at least twice each year for most children. Some children may need check-ups more often. Birth to 6 Months Old Clean your baby’s mouth with water (should be avoided as it may inadvertently lead to drinking water) and a cloth or gauze or use a soft infant toothbrush after feedings and at bedtime. Both should be avoided in breastfed baby as white milk patch on the tongue is protecting your baby against the entry of bugs. Ensure exclusive breastfeeding. 6–12 Months Old During this time, the first tooth should appear. But, do not worry if your baby does not have a tooth until 15 months of age. Brush teeth after each feeding and at bedtime with a finger brush or a very small, soft-bristled brush. Use a very small amount of toothpaste, about the size of a grain of rice . As your child begins to walk, stay alert of possible dental or facial injuries  1–3 Years Old Follow the schedule of dental checkups cleanings, as recommended by your child’s dentist. Generally, dental checkups and cleanings are recommended every 6 months for children and adults. At about age of 3 years, as your child learns to rinse and spit, brushing with a pea-sized portion of toothpaste is best.For All Ages Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing Rinse toothbrushes thoroughly after brushing and ensure that each one can dry without touching other toothbrushes. Replace toothbrushes every few months, when the bristles become flattened with use. Between meals, quench a child’s thirst with water. Do not offer candy, dried fruit (including raisins), and sugared drinks or juices. Take your child for regular dental visits. Early checkups help to prevent cavities and tooth decay, which can lead to pain, trouble concentrating, and other medical issues. It is not uncommon to see many young children with cavities caused by  falling asleep with a bottle of milk or juice. This practice is to be strongly discouraged. The importance of encouraging children to drink milk and water from a cup as they approach their first birthday need to be emphasized to parents. As kids get older, their bite and the straightness of their teeth can become an issue. Orthodontists know that manipulation of teeth at a younger age can be easier and more effective in the long run. Younger children’s teeth can be positioned with minor orthodontic devices, preventing major treatment later."}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "Which is the best toothbrush and toothpaste for children?", "response": " Toothbrushes: It is important to choose the right toothbrush—one designed especially for children aged 2–5 years. These toothbrushes have small oval heads, soft bristles of different heights and nonslip, and cushioned handles. They may have cartoons and fun designs on the handle, which your child might like. Keeping Toothbrushes Clean After cleaning your child’s teeth and gums, rinse the toothbrush with tap water. Store the toothbrush upright in an open container to allow it to air-dry. Replace toothbrushes every 3–4 months, or when the bristles get worn or frayed. Toothpaste and Fluoride You can start using low-fluoride toothpaste on your child’s toothbrush from 2 years of age. Fluoride is a safe mineral that keeps teeth strong and prevents tooth decay. Fluoride works best when you get it in very small amounts throughout the day in fluoridated tap water, foods and drinks containing fluoride, and low-fluoride toothpaste"}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "What is the right brushing technique for kids?", "response": " The six steps show you how to brush your child’s teeth correctly (18 months to 6 years): 1. Smear a pea-sized amount of toothpaste onto a soft children’s toothbrush. 2. Sit the child in your lap, facing away from you, or stand behind taller children. Tilt the child’s head back against your body so you can see all the surfaces of the teeth. 3. Angle the bristles of the toothbrush toward the gum. Move the brush in gentle circles to clean the outer sides of the teeth and gums. 4. Rush in gentle circles on the inside of the teeth and gums. 5. Brush back and forward on the chewing surface of the teeth. 6. After brushing all the surfaces, encourage your child to spit out the toothpaste."}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "Can sweetened liquids cause tooth decay?", "response": "Tooth decay in infants and very young children is often referred to as baby bottle tooth decay. It happens when sweetened liquids or those with natural sugars (like milk, formula, and fruit juice) cling to an infant’s teeth for a long time. Bacteria in the mouth thrive on this sugar and make acids that attack the teeth. Children whose pacifiers are frequently dipped in sugar or syrup are at risk.Giving an infant a sugary drink at nap-time or night-time is particularly harmful because the flow of saliva decreases during sleep. Although baby bottle tooth decay typically happens in the upper front teeth, other teeth may also be affected."}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": " Is nibbling in between meals is OK?", "response": "After a meal, our saliva can repair the dental enamel that has been corroded by the food acids, but this process takes some time. Frequent and/or particularly sweet snacks overstrain this natural and protective repair mechanism; therefore, try to minimize nibbling on baked treats, bananas, candies, or sweets between meals. Instead offer your kids sugarless products such as whole grain homemade bread and fruits. Be sure your child eats correctly to maintain a healthy body and teeth: Shop smart. Do not normally stock your pantry with sugary or starchy snacks. Limit the number of snack times. Choose healthy snacks. Provide a balanced diet and save foods with sugar or starch for mealtimes. Do not put your young child to bed with a bottle of milk, formula, or juice."}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "Can thumb sucking, lip sucking and tongue thrusting cause dental problems?", "response": " It is normal for infants to suck their thumbs, fingers, or toys, to an extent. Object sucking gives children a sense of emotional security and comfort.  But, if these habits continue beyond the age of 5 years, when the permanent teeth begin to come in, dental problems can occur. Depending on the frequency, intensity, and duration, the teeth can be pushed out of alignment, causing them to protrude and create an overbite. Your child may also have difficulty with the correct pronunciation of words.  In addition, the upper and lower jaws can become misaligned, is it misaligned or malaligned and the roof of the mouth might become malformed. There are dental appliances your child can wear in the mouth to prevent these habits. These appliances are cemented to the upper teeth, sit on the roof of the mouth, and make thumb sucking or tongue thrusting harder and less pleasurable."}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "What is fluoride treatment and what are dental sealants?", "response": " Fluoride Treatment Dentists provide professional fluoride treatments in the form of a highly concentrated rinse, foam, gel, or varnish. The treatment may be applied with a swab, brush, tray, or mouthwash. These treatments have much more fluoride than what is in your water or toothpaste. They only take a few minutes to apply. You may be asked to avoid eating or drinking for 30 minutes after the treatment so the fluoride can fully absorb. Dental Sealants As your child’s permanent teeth grow in, the dentist can help to prevent decay by applying a thin wash of resin (called a sealant) to the back teeth, where most chewing is done. This protective coating keeps bacteria from settling in the hard-to-reach crevices of the molars. But, make sure that kids know that sealants are not a replacement for good brushing and regular flossing"}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "Is it safe for me to use diapers for my baby throughout the day?", "response": "Diapers for babies are safe if judiciously used with understanding and adequate measures. Due to its ease of use and disposal, it is preferred by a lot of mothers and is extensively used nowadays. Choose the diapers according to need and not according to brand. When traveling for prolonged period of time, use disposable diapers to ensure safe and hassle-free travel. When at home, use light cotton diapers or nappies and change these frequently, every 2–3 hours or when soiled (whichever is earlier). Many babies wake up frequently at night due to soiling of diaper, it might be a good idea to use diapers for them to ensure good sleep. Diapers are in direct contact with baby’s delicate skin, and hence, prone to rashes and allergies. Use of appropriate rash-free and protective creams and adequate diaper free airing time is essential to ensure healthy skin and happy babies."}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "What precautions should take before and after using diaper for my baby?", "response": " Diapers are in direct contact with the baby’s skin and are known to cause rashes, contact dermatitis, and even fungal infection if not used properly (Fig. 2). So, it is advisable to taking precautions to avoid side effects: First check that the baby does not have any rash in the area. Use nappy cream or moisturizer lotion after cleaning the area with soft cloth or cotton and water. Change the diaper every 2–3 hours,  even if it is dry. This ensures that the baby remains comfortable, rash free, and dry. Ensure that you change the diaper immediately if soiled with stools/urine. After removing the diaper, leave the area open and dry to air for some time before putting on the next diaper. This is done to let the skin breathe"}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "What is the ideal age for us to stop using diapers for our baby?", "response": " In many parts of the world, like in India, toilet training begins in early infancy. Without force but with timely intervention and regular methods, babies learn the basic toilet skills and never or rarely wear diapers. This has a huge benefit in terms of preventing fungal or urinary tract infections and is cheaper. However, with the growing clan of “potty experts”, toilet training is starting from 18–24 months. Children usually take longer to be dry at night than in the day. However, once your child is reasonably toilet trained, you can try leaving off the nappy at night, encouraging him to use the toilet before going to sleep and as soon as he wakes up. In certain populations, it is only after the age of 3 years that children are taught toilet skills and diapers are stopped at 3–4 years of age. But, the downside of these are many compared to any benefit and should be discouraged."}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "My mother and other elders at home are insisting that I keep the baby swaddled all the time. Is it essential to do so?", "response": "Swaddling has been a part of caring of babies for centuries. It makes  the baby feel like it is in the womb or being snuggled close. By keeping  the swaddle for sleepy times, you are creating associations that will help your baby sleep well. Do’s and Don’ts Do not keep them swaddled all the time and not if they do not like it, listen to the signals by your baby. It may cause overheating in the babies. Unswaddle them when they are awake, feeding, or playing.  It will ensure that the baby is wide awake and ready to breastfeed adequately. Babies’ legs need to be able to bend up and out at the hips for healthy development of hips, unswaddling at timely intervals ensures that. Do not swaddle too tightly; if baby rolls over her tummy, she/he will not be able to roll back. This increases risk of suffocation Swaddle only with a light blanket and always leave two fingers of space between baby’s chest and cloth."}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "Should I be making my newborn baby wear a cap even when at home?", "response": " There is a common misconception that newborn babies need caps to stay warm. It is not true in healthy full-term babies. The temperature regulation is by the maternal contact. Caps should be used when stepping outside with the baby. At that time, judge whether you feel chilled or not. If you feel cold, it is understood that your baby is cold too. Respond appropriately to the change in temperatures to avoid overheating the baby by unnecessary head cover"}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "My baby sucks on the mittens I put on his hands. Should I stop using the mittens?", "response": "Most parents believe that newborn babies must wear scratch mittens to prevent injuries to themselves by scratching, due to the uncoordinated movements normally seen in them, especially when hungry. However, this can be managed better by keeping fingernails short and responding quickly to a baby’s feeding cues. Reasons why mittens should not be used: Fig. 4: Mittens and a cap for a baby. After all babies have managed perfectly well without mittens in the mother’s womb (Fig. 4). Babies cannot comfort themselves by sucking on fingers or thumb. It would lead to missing feeding cues. It acts as a barrier to the skin-to-skin contact which is so essential while breastfeeding"}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "What kind of clothes should I choose to buy for my baby considering our climatic conditions?", "response": "When selecting clothes for your baby, it is natural to get swayed by the fancy coloring and accessorizing that is widely available. Keep a few things in mind while purchasing clothes. Cotton is the most suitable clothing, compatible with our kind of climate. It is safe from allergies, allows the skin to breathe, and prevents overheating. Look out for buttons and other decorative items on the clothing, if pulled out by the baby easily, it can be a choking hazard. Prefer to buy clothing with front opening and check for good quality zipper and buttons which are safe and skin friendly for the babies."}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "How should I wash my baby’s clothes?", "response": " Baby’s skin as we know is delicate and prone to infection and rashes when exposed to foreign irritant substances. This can be due to the detergent you are using or that the clothes have not got adequately disinfected. Tips for Washing of Clothes Wash new clothes before putting them on the baby to make them safe, clean, and free from any allergy. Wash nappies and diapers separately even if you are washing the baby’s clothes with the rest at home. Avoid using very hot or warm water, it will cause deforming or discoloring of the clothes. Rinse the clothes more number of times in water. Dry them in open space in fresh air and sunlight. Use a dye-free and chemical-free detergent to wash the clothes."}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "My teenage daughter is developing rashes in her inner thighs. It gets worse after wearing jeans. Could it be because of allergy or because they are tight?", "response": "The advertisements of skin fit jeans as the most fashionable attire attract a lot of attention from teenagers . But what is not advertised is the multitude of problems these clothes can cause when worn for long periods of time. Nerve compression especially in girls causing pins and needle sensations, tingling, and numbness in the thighs. Spinal and muscle disorders: Tight jeans or skirts can cause restriction of natural movement of muscles and joints while walking and sitting. Body hugging jeans with high heels cause knee problems.

Fungal infections: Candidiasis can occur with prolonged wearing of tight jeans."}
{"label":"Dental Care, Diapers, and Clothing","prompt": "What kind of clothing should be worn by children when they have fever?", "response": "Light cotton clothing should be used to prevent overheating in a child with fever. Do not bundle up the febrile child with heavy blankets or too many warm clothes, as they may impair heat loss from the body."}
{"label":"Prevention of Accidents and Injuries","prompt": " How can we make our homes safer and prevent physical injuries in children?", "response": "Some areas and objects in the house are more prone to cause injuries to a child. Be aware of such possibilities to avoid accidents. Staircase: When your child starts crawling, install safety guards across entries to stairs and balconies. Balconies and parapet walls/grills: The parapet wall should be tall enough and wide enough to prevent the fall of a child trying to look down over it. Ensure that there are no objects near the parapet wall that a child can climb to then climb on to the parapet wall or the balcony grill. The grill design should not make it easy to climb (not have climbable horizontal members). Windows: When your child starts climbing, lock windows—particularly upper-story windows—restrict window openings or shield them with grills or nets having a widest opening of 4 inches. Furniture: It should be sturdy and stable—a child should not be able to pull it down or knock it. Any sharp projecting ends or corners should be rounded or padded or covered with corner protectors. Children may run into drawers left pulled out and can get injured. Install drawer guards, if available. Flat screen televisions should be fixed to a clamp, or to the wall.Glass: Install safety glass in windows and doors or apply shatter-resistant film to windows and doors. Tools and weapons: Lock away tools like saws and drills. Keep lawn mowers, chain saws and other sharp tools and guns or knives strictly out of reach of all children and adolescents. Baby cots: Cots or beds for small children should not have horizontal bars or footholds that your baby can use to climb out. Space between bars should be 5–9.5 cm (gaps wider than 9.5 cm could trap your child’s head or let your child fall out of the cot) and at least 60 cm tall. The lock must not be openable by the child. Check that the mattress is firm. Light: Leave a hall light on at night or use sensor lights. Floor: Whenever possible, avoid multiple levels or steps on the same floor. A non-slippery floor texture is desirable. Bathroom and the kitchen: These are the most accident-prone areas in the house. Whenever, not in use, please lock them. Train the child from a very early age to keep away from the kitchen platform. Locks: All locks should be above the level of 4 feet so that a child does not accidentally lock someone in the bathroom/any room nor open it by himself before he becomes self-reliant"}
{"label":"Prevention of Accidents and Injuries","prompt": "What is a safe way to put a baby to sleep? ", "response": "Place your baby on his or her back for all sleep times whether day or night. Babies who sleep on their backs are much less likely to die of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) than babies who sleep on their sides or stomachs. Use a firm, flat sleep surface, such as a mattress covered only by a properly fitted sheet. Soft surfaces can increase the risk of sleep-related death. A firm sleep surface helps reduce the risk of SIDS and suffocation. Keep your baby’s sleep area (for example, a crib or bassinet) in the same room where you sleep until your baby is at least 1-year old. Placing the crib close to your bed so that the baby is within view and reach can also help make it easier to feed, comfort, and monitor your baby.Keep soft bedding such as blankets, pillows, and soft toys out of your baby’s sleep area. Additionally, do not cover your baby’s head or allow your baby to get too hot. Keeping blankets and pillows increase the risk of suffocation. When some older children are made to sleep on the bed, it will be wise to keep some cushioned mattress on the floor by the side of the bed. Do not keep a phone charging near the cot/bed ofthe child. Keep the main door of the room open and the bathroom attached to the room bolted when going outside for some work for a while."}
{"label":"Prevention of Accidents and Injuries","prompt": "My friend’s 18-month-old daughter jumped out of her arms and fell. Now I am feeling scared to lift my baby. How should we safely hold our baby?", "response": "Make sure your hands are clean and dry before you lift a baby. When holding a newborn, it is very important to always have a hand to support the head and neck until 3 months of age (when they normally develop head control).You can hold the newborn in following positions: Cradle hold: Cradling a baby is a natural and simple method. Place the baby’s head in the crook of one of your arms with the hand supporting the bottom, and wrap your other arm around the baby to hold your first arm  Shoulder hold: Lean your baby up on against your shoulder. Support the bottom using the same side forearm. Secure the grip with your other hand behind the baby’s neck and head (Fig. 2). Belly grip: Place the baby prone. Slide your hand under his chest to support it while encircling its shoulder with your thumb andgripping the arm. Lift  the baby to keep thehead a little higher than the legs and the body snugged to your trunk. Babies (especially when colicky) like this position for short duration of time  As the infant grows, sometimes they become very restless when being carried. Waist hold: One safe way is to straddle their legs one in front and one behind the waist with the bottom supported by your side of waist and the trunk held with your arm wrapped around the baby firmly. Ensure a tight grip on this because babies can be unpredictable and may suddenly swoon in one direction to slip out of your grip Baby carrying boards, slings, and monkey bags are available in the market to secure your baby better and at the same time allowing you to use your one or bothhands. Use the one that is age appropriate for your baby."}

What can be done to avoid such kind of incidents both at home and outside?", "response": "We often hear incidents of drowning in ponds, swimming pools, rivers, and oceans and of course village wells but drowning can occur even in anyone’s home. A few suggestions for preventing such horrific mishaps are as under: Bathrooms should always be bolted with bolts on the upper end. Avoid having bathtubs in homes with little children. Never keep water stored in buckets because small kids can often fall into it. If at all one has to store the buckets should be covered and door bolted from outside. Never leave your child alone in the bathroom. Teach your child to swim as soon as possible—usually after 3–5 years of age. All adults must learn the basics of swimming (floating, moving through the water) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). If you have a pool at home, ensure that it is fenced on all sides, with selfclosing and self-latching gates. Kids should wear life jackets in and around lakes, rivers or the ocean. They must be closely supervised by an adult when in or near water (including bathtubs)."}
{"label":"Prevention of Accidents and Injuries","prompt": "What should we do immediately after a child meets with some accident on a holiday or at odd hours?", "response": "All parents and teachers must learn basic CPR and basic first aid.

{"label":"Screen Time Guidelines for Parents","prompt": "I  have heard that screen time has an effect on children.  What is meant by screen time?", "response": " Screen time is the total time spent per day in viewing screens such as mobile phone, TV, computer, tablet, or any hand-held or visual device. Screens have become an essential part of our life. Parents, teachers, and health professionals are concerned about the increase in children’s screen time. Just like the balanced food that we eat, screens need to be properly chosen and to be consumed in the right quantity and at the right time. The way we use the screens determines whether it is healthy or unhealthy. Screen time spent for educational or prosocial activities such as schoolwork, interacting with friends and relatives, and creating art or music or relaxation is termed positive or healthy, while watching inappropriate TV shows, visiting unsafe websites, or playing violent video games are few examples of negative or unhealthy screen time."}
{"label":"Screen Time Guidelines for Parents","prompt": "For how long can my child use screens? Should I limit screen time?", "response": "Children below the age of 2 years should not be exposed to any type of screen with the exception of occasional video call with relatives.  Screen time for children between the age of 2 and 5 years should not exceed  1 hour; the lesser, the better.  For older children and adolescents, it is important to balance screen time with other activities that are required for overall development. These activities include an hour of physical activity (play time), adequate duration of sleep (recommended sleep time varies with age, for example, adolescents require 8–9 hours of uninterrupted sleep at night), and time for schoolwork, meals, hobbies, and family time. If any of these activities is displaced due to screen use, then it is called excessive screen time and it should be reduced."}

{"label":"Screen Time Guidelines for Parents","prompt": "How can I motivate my child to use media in a healthy way?", "response": " Children feel secure when boundaries and rules are laid down for behavior. You should formulate “digital rules” to encourage healthy media usage when your child begins to use a digital device. These should be age appropriate and new rules could be added as the child becomes older.  A few rules for maintaining “digital hygiene” are: Ensure a warm, nurturing, supportive, fun-filled, and secure environment at home. Children follow rules, if they are guided in a respectful and empathetic manner. Do not use a screen for calming or distracting a child. Balance screen time with adequate time for sleep, physical activity, study, family, meals, and hobby time. Screens should be switched off 1 hour before bedtime, as blue light emitted from devices disturbs sleep. The correct posture to be adopted while sitting in front of the computer and the mobile phone is shown in the figures below, respectively. To reduce eyestrain and dryness of eyes, itis important to follow 20-20-20 rule as outlined in the figure below.Avoid multitasking. While doing offline homework, all digital devices should be switched off. Keep children safe by co-viewing and monitoring the online content and interactions. Avoid programs and games with violent content. Also, ensure proper privacy settings on the computer, safe search engines on browsers and apps, and anti-virus software. For young children, install protective software to restrict access to inappropriate websites.Encourage the use of media for educational purposes and promote physical activity and offline creative games for recreation. Use “teachable moments” on the media to convey family values, healthy lifestyle, and interpret media messages. For example, irresponsible sexual behavior leading to unwanted pregnancy can be talked about while co-viewing  showing casual sexual encounters between teens. Mark digital free zones such as bedroom, dining table, kitchen, bathroom, and motorized vehicles where no family member uses a gadget. Decide upon a digital fasting time when no family member uses any device and utilizes thattime for family bonding.  You should role model healthy media use and formulate a family media usage plan."}

Can media addiction be cured?", "response": "Unhealthy use of media can lead to addiction. Internet gaming addiction is a mental disorder. If your child compulsively uses media, craves for it, has lost control over its usage, gets violent when asked to stop its use, and continues to use despite adverse consequences such as fall  in academic performance and loss  of friendships, he is probably addicted  to it. Media addiction may be associated with other disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and anxiety. Media addiction can be treated by consulting mental health professionals. When you find oneor more flag signs given above, do consult with your pediatrician or a mental health professional at the earliest."}
{"label":"Screen Time Guidelines for Parents","prompt": " I am very careful about screen use.  Does my screen time have an effect on my child?", "response": "Your screen time does have an effecton your child.

{"label":"Parental Concerns Regarding Schooling","prompt": "What school characteristics should I consider, while selecting a school for my child?", "response": "The most important factor that influences a child’s schooling is his feeling of connectedness to the school. The home, the social milieu, and the school should be culturally compatible for the child to feel comfortable at school. Policies: Management policies of the school, the principal’s strategies, the teachers’ competence, the student teacher ratio, the educational board, the medium, and the scope for cocurricular activities all contribute in the school environment and should be looked for. The infrastructure: The campus, the building, the classrooms, the furniture, the playground, the equipment, the hygiene and health facilities, etc. should be given due consideration. Others: The fees structure, school timings, the distance from the home, commute facilities, feedbacks from other parents, etc. should be considered. The priorities should be decided according to the availability of choice, the family circumstances, the child’s temperament and interests, and his/her individualized  requirements. The Best School Every child is different and has his strengths and weaknesses. The best school is the one that promotes his strengths (for example, in a sport activity) and helps him to overcome his weaknesses (for example, in academics). A school that is open for communications and suggestions and willing to join hands with parents for the wellbeing of children should be given precedence "}
{"label":"Parental Concerns Regarding Schooling","prompt": "What is the right age to start education? ", "response": " The brain growth occurs rapidly till the age of 6 years when the brain is still moldable like wet clay. The nerve cells and their connections are strengthened during this crucial period. Those nerve paths in the brain which are used repeatedly become strong and the ones that are not used are lost. Sensory development, small muscle control, hand eye coordination, balancing, language and communication, social mannerisms, and adjusting with peers are some of the points the child needs to learn in this phase of life (Fig. 1). It forms the basis of further learning, both formal and informal. Therefore, it is necessary to make the best use of this phase of life and provide a developmentally appropriate environment to the young children. The joint families and the social milieu prevalent in the past provided ample opportunities for the child to get exposed to various stimulating situations. Now, with the changing societal fabric and nuclear families, children miss out on these important learning opportunities. Hence, it is desirable that they are exposed to a setup, where there is a chance for informal learning and peer interaction, after the age of 3 years. This has also been suggested in the New Education Policy of Government of India,  2020."}
{"label":"Parental Concerns Regarding Schooling","prompt": "How to decide among various educational boards, CBSE, state boards, international boards, etc.", "response": "  To decide the Board for the child, following considerations are useful: Location: State board schools are available till the remotest places, while CBSE and other boards’ schools are generally located only in metros. The board should be selected depending on the family’s chances of relocating (as in case of transfer or job change). The child should not be required to jump educational boards frequently. Academic contents: State level boards focus on regional contexts and promote academics accordingly. They impart knowledge based on local culture, history, geography, general information, vocational training as per the local trends and requirements. The national boards follow the national context. Their curricula are more extensive and academically more demanding. But, if the student is likely to appear for the national level entrance tests, these boards are a better choice. Process of learning: The Indian system of education, as of now, focuses more on outcomes measured by paper pencil examinations. The information load, the rote learning style, and the structured pattern of addressing the curricula are challenging for many students. International Boards International boards are, in contrast, pretty much child centric. There is a wide choice and flexibility regarding what to learn and how to learn. They promote self-learning and encourage personalized learning styles. They assess efforts rather than the end results of learning and also give due weightage to extra-curricular achievements. They aim at helping the children compete in the international education stream. Schooling for such boards is comparatively expensive."}
{"label":"Parental Concerns Regarding Schooling","prompt": "Should we consider home schooling/open schooling especially with the Corona pandemic", "response": " Education of children is massively affected in the pandemic and different methods employed to continue the formal learning are grossly inadequate. Home schooling is increasingly adapted by many parents, looking at the uncertainty and risk of in person schooling. National Institute of Open Schooling is a Board of Education under the Ministry of Human Resources, Government of India, at par with other boards. It runs learner friendly distant self-learning courses for all school years up to 12th standard since 1989. It also conducts informal courses on life skills and vocational training. The course material is delivered via post as well as through dedicated radio and TV channels. There is a lot of flexibility regarding choice of subjects and duration of the course. The contact programs and assignments are run, and the final assessment examinations are conducted. The physically handicapped, the school dropouts, and the residents of rural and remote areas had been the beneficiaries of this board since long. It also helps  the students who pursue vocational trainings or undertake jobs while completing their formal school education. The open schooling system has a robust and timetested infrastructure for remote learning of school going children. During COVID times, it appears to be a reasonable alternative for maintaining the continuity of structured education of the children"}
{"label":"Parental Concerns Regarding Schooling","prompt": "It is said that children learn better in their mother tongue but the higher education and job prospects are better for English language. How can we address this issue?", "response": " “Mother tongue” is presumed to be the child’s “first” language—the language of greatest proficiency and comfort. It may or may not be the regional language of the state. Many studies conducted around the world have shown that children in bilingual (two languages) programs, with mother tongue as the medium of instruction, perform better than their peers taught in other languages. They have a deeper awareness of how languages work, display greater flexibility of thinking, and achieve better academic outcomes. Further, the longer they remain in mother tongue education, the better is their knowledge retention and performance in the school. Why English? Humans have a great potential to learn many languages. The Central Government has an official three-language policy. Technical and higher education courses in India generally run in English. It also serves as an important link language within our country and also globally. English, therefore, should be introduced as a subject in the early years so that the children learn its basics as an additional language, early in life. As they master it, the same can be gradually used as a co-teaching medium for science and mathematics. This will give our children the best of both the worlds. However, if the child is not able to cope up, he should not be burdened with English medium."}
{"label":"Parental Concerns Regarding Schooling","prompt": "What should ideally be the weight of the school bag? ", "response": "  Children carrying heavy school bags may suffer from backache, neckache, armache, and headache. Furthermore, they view their school as a source of “burden” and get into psychological stress. Proper planning and implementation of subject-wise timetable, lesser number of books and copies, loose sheets and files, and school lockers are some ways to reduce the burden on tender shoulders (Fig. 2). Government Guidelines In 2016, the Union Human Resource and Development Ministry formed the guidelines to ensure that students are not burdened by carrying heavy bags to schools. These guidelines were framed after it was observed that the load of school bag is increased by bringing textbooks, homework and classwork notebooks, rough work notebooks, guides, water bottles, lunch box, etc. Weight limits of school bags for students as per the Government of India are as follows: Classes 1 and 2: Not exceeding 1.5 kg Classes 3 to 5: 2–3 kg Classes 6 and 7: 4 kg Classes 8 and 9: 4.5 kg Class 10: 5 kg In May 2019, the Karnataka government also ordered all schools in the state to ensure that the weight of a child’s school bag does not exceed 10% of the weight of the child."}
{"label":"Parental Concerns Regarding Schooling","prompt": "How much time should the children be doing assignments, homework, etc. at home? What good study skills we should promote in our children?", "response": " Time for assignments varies with age, half an hour in primary classes, 1 hour in middle school and 2 hours in high schools is acceptable. Home work should preferably be activity based. Smart study habits imbibed in school age help the children to complete their work timely and fruitfully. Children should be helped in the following ways: Provide a quiet place free from distraction and interruption. Provide a structured timetable of the day with designated study time. Topics to study should be pre-decided. A short break after every 30–50 minutes study session. Not to remain hungry while studying. No multitasking such as studying and watching TV together. Studying with friends, discussions, sharing notes, and quizzing. While studying, they should follow three “S”: 1. Skim: It means to review. 2. Scrutinize: Focus on important stuff in the chapter. 3. Sweep up: After finishing the topic, revise the assigned chapters again. Memory Technique Grouping—organizing material by grouping similar concepts or ideas. Creating associations: Associating something new with something already known. Learning actively: Moving of hands, pacing back and forth and using gestures while reciting. Creating models, pictures, flowcharts and mnemonics Repeating and reciting few important points Writing it down Children should be encouraged to discuss difficult topics with their friends and teachers. Discussions help in clearing doubts and also the discussed things are better memorized."}
{"label":"Parental Concerns Regarding Schooling","prompt": "Should we encourage extracurricular activities  and sports in the school?", "response": " Yes, definitely the schools and the parents should encourage extracurricular activities among children. These activities including the National Cadet Corps (NCC), Scout, etc. offer children a chance to explore themselves, improve their self-esteem and sometimes may open a career path for them. The healthy competitive spirit of these informal school activities imbibe a camarederie among the children. Sports: Sports help in building a healthy body and a healthy mind. Children learn cooperation, team spirit,  and sportsman spirit. They are more likely to perform better in stressful situations and learn to face the failures boldly. Performing arts: Dancing, singing, theater, and fine arts such as drawing, painting, etc. boost creativity and are good stress busters. Children get a chance to express themselves through these art forms. Involving children in various competitions and stage performances helps them to overcome the stage fear and boosts their confidence. Such group activities teach them adjustment skills, empathy, communication skills, and leadership  qualities"}
{"label":"Parental Concerns Regarding Schooling","prompt": "What food stuffs are good to take during school lunch breaks? What is your opinion regarding  mid-day meal and school canteen food?", "response": " A healthy and hygienic school lunch covers one-third of nutritional needs of the child. This goes a long way in his physical, mental, and academic well-being, and also inculcates in him, right eating habits. School Lunch School lunch should be made up of cereals such as wheat, rice, lentils along with vegies/salads/fruits. It should be attractive, colorful, tasty, and easy to eat. Rather than roti sabji, children prefer a roll of the same or paratha in the school tiffin. Freshly cooked homemade items such as idli, upama, chila, and sandwiches are easy healthy options. Products such as cheese, egg, and nuts can add nutritional value to the lunch. Avoid Junk Food Junk food that is high in calories and fats, ultra-processed food such as noodles, pizzas, and carbonated and caffeinated cold drinks should best be avoided in the lunch pack as well as in the school canteens. If due care is taken, school canteens can serve healthy and hygienic food and meet the nutritional demands of the students. They also imbibe a sense of equality among them. Mid-day Meals Mid-day meals are a great way to improve not only the nutritional status of children but also their school attendance. They provide significant financial relief to the economically backward families and save the children from child labor. The meals should be nutritious, culture compatible and preferably freshly cooked from the ingredients easily available in the locality, taking utmost care of health and hygiene. "}
{"label":"Parental Concerns Regarding Schooling","prompt": "Can you guide us about how to help  the child with online learning?", "response": "Parents should familiarize themselves with the new educational system and new technology. They should provide the means of learning and guide their children in using the means such as laptop, tablet, etc. They should coview the online lessons (or study material) for students mandatorily for preprimary and up to 2nd grade; preferably for 3rd–5th graders; and desirably for older children. Explanatory conversation and guidance help children to learn the contents better. Elder children should be offered a helping hand to learn new ways and means of learning to ease out their online work. Schools should be requested not to exceed the age and stage appropriate recommendations of time and number of online classes . Learning should be stress free and academic demands should be reasonable.  The home environment should be calm and conducive for learning. Cyber safety rules should be taught to the children and their online activities should be monitored. Children should be encouraged to follow ergonomic practices while using screens. Eye strain should be reduced by asking them to look at an object 20 feet away, for 20 seconds, after every 20 minutes of screening. Frequently blinking of eyes should be encouraged (Fig. 3). Online learning is stressful for children. They should not be overburdened with unrealistic academic expectations. Healthy lifestyle and good bonding should be maintained to reduce the stress"}
{"label":"Toys, Plays, and Sports","prompt": "What kind of toys and games should be introduced to  children at different ages?", "response": "Play is one of the most important aspects of a child’s life. It is the key to how children learn, express their feelings, form relationships, and engage with others. Below is one possible way to categorize toys. If your child has developmental delay or another such concern, consider the developmental level your child is at currently rather than the age in deciding what kind of toys your child may engage with. For example, your child may be 3 years old but has not yet reached the level of pretend play, so he/she may enjoy more sensory level toys such as bubbles, squeezy balls, and simple pop-up toys. Anything can be a toy, from pieces of paper to a bottle of water. You do not need to buy expensive and fancy toys. But, you do need to encourage your child to engage with material physically, as children do not learn just by watching a screen or by being told verbally, they learn by doing. Types of toys1. Sensory toys : These are toys that stimulate the different senses of a child—sight, hearing, and touch and teach basic cause and effect (X leads  to Y, e.g., shaking the rattle  makes noise). Ex:Rattles, squeezable toys, teething toys, textured balls, and bubbles. Approximate age:2 months onward;2.Combinatorial toys :These are toys that can be combined in different ways and teach the child to build.Example : tacking rings, blocks, nesting cups, and puzzles . Approxiamte age : 1year onward;3.Pretend play toys : Pretend play is an important stage in development, as it signals that the child is able to understand the difference between the real world and the pretend (mental) world. Ex:Dolls, puppets, doctor set, and kitchen set . Approximate age: 1.5 year onward;4. Movementbased activities :Child involved in physical movement . Ex; wings, slides, seesaw, and balls to kick/throw. Approximate age : 2 years onward (swing, small slide—with supervision) Baby swings are available for younger children ;5. books : In print form, to read, tell stories, and discuss emotions . Ex: Board books, picture books, and story books The younger the child, the more pictures/textures in books are likely to attract the child . Approximate age: 1year onward6. Board games and card games : These support the child to learn rules, turn-taking, and ideas of winning/losing . Ex: Snakes and Ladder, Ludo, and Uno. Approximate age: 6 years onwards7. Social games:These games teach turn-taking and different social skills required while playing with other people . Ex: Passing the parcel and hide-and-seek Cricket and Football are more complex team games that need one to cooperate with others to succeed. Approximate age: 3–5 years onward (depending on the game)"}
{"label":"Toys, Plays, and Sports","prompt": "What kinds of toys and games can be harmful for my child?", "response": "Till at least 3 years of age, toys should have big parts to avoid risk of choking.  Avoid toys with sharp edges.  Toys made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (a type of plastic) can expose the child to lead and cadmium (which are toxic), especially if the child mouths the toys.  It is important for adults to supervise outdoor activities, till at least 6 years (and beyond, if you feel your child needs it), as there is a risk of falling and injury"}
{"label":"Toys, Plays, and Sports","prompt": "Should I allow my child to play as he/she wants, or should  I direct him/her to specific classes? ", "response": "Free play means allowing your child to play as he/she wants and not as the adult directs the child (e.g., young children may prefer to tear paper rather than scribble on it or an older child may use a bus as a bridge rather than driving it). Free play is important at all ages. It allows children to use their imagination and be creative. You should definitely allow your child to play freely. However, if the child engages in inappropriate actions (throwing toys at people and hitting others), you should not ignore it and gently but firmly redirect the child to a more appropriate action. If you ignore it, the child will learn that these actions are acceptable and will continue to do them. At the same time, this does not mean that the child’s entire time has to be free play. There is value in doing structured activities with your child such as puzzles and playing games with rules. However, before 2 years of age, your child will generally not engage in structured activities on your command. This is perfectly okay. Remember that your child’s attention span is much lesser than yours, and even 10 minutes is very long for a 2-year-old child to sit and do something!"}
{"label":"Toys, Plays, and Sports","prompt": "How can I spend time in playing with my child?", "response": "As adults, we often think that play is for children, and it is silly or unnecessary for us to engage in it. However, playing with our child can be an excellent way of building a relationship with the child, finding out his/her thoughts and concerns, and teaching the child the importance of recreation. While playing with children, give them the freedom to choose what they want to play and how they want to play. Play at the level of the children, i.e., sit down where they are—sitting, make eye contact, and copying their actions. Giving too many instructions or always using play to ask questions to test their knowledge can put off the children. Instead, you can describe or comment on the child’s actions. For example, if the child is arranging some cars, you can say—“Oh, you are making a car park”. Or, if the child has drawn something, you can say—“Oh, you have drawn a yellow flower”"}
{"label":"Toys, Plays, and Sports","prompt": "There is barely any time or avenues to engage in sports nowadays. How important is it to expose my child to sports?", "response": "It is important to expose your child to sports. Sports can help children to develop and maintain physical health, to learn playing by the rules and in a team, to learn the importance of discipline and practice, and to find a source of enjoyment and fun. They also learn to be resilient in life and to face disappointment and failure on losing in a game with courage and perseverance. Exposure does not mean that children have to be good at the sport or that they have to take part in competitions.  It means that the children find something  that they enjoy. Examples of sports that children may enjoy include—football, swimming, cricket, running, carom, dancing, gymnastics, badminton, khokho, kabaddi, etc. It is a good idea to start exposing the child to sports at younger ages, preferably before puberty, when the child is fairly open for trying out different activities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that children aged 3–5 years should be physically active throughout the day. WHO has recommended 3 hours of daily physical activity for 1–4 years old. Children aged 5–17 years should have at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic physical activity a day. If we do not expose children to sport, there is a risk that they do not engage in physical activity when they grow older."}
{"label":"Toys, Plays, and Sports","prompt": "How should I decide which sport to engage my child in? If my child does not want to engage in sports, what should I do?", "response": "To decide which sport to engage your child in, the main factor to consider is your child’s interest and likes. Secondly, you can consider which sport is accessible to you in terms of expense, time, space, and coaching. It is your role to provide your child with the option of playing sports and encouragement to do the same. However, do not force the child to play a sport because of your personal liking"}
{"label":"Toys, Plays, and Sports","prompt": "Can sports have any harmful effects in the long run?", "response": "Participation in sports offers many benefits, as described above. However, if your child is pursuing sports at a competitive/professional level, the training regimes can be very strict and vigorous and coaches may not understand the physical and mental limits of children. This can lead to a greater risk of injuries and burnout. Hence, it is recommended that:  There should be scheduled rest periods and limits on time spent in sports (>16 hours/week is not recommended)  The intensity of the training and any injuries should be carefully monitored, as when children go through puberty, there can be more injuries, as their bodies are still developing.  Many parents encourage their children to engage in a single sport, as they feel; it will lead to specialization at a competitive level. However, participating in one single sport can have greater risk of injury due to doing the same repetitive movements and can also lead to decreased motivation and enjoyment.  Adequate emotional support should be provided to the child and it should be ensured that the child does not feel pressurized to participate in the sport. Sports should always be for recreation, physical fitness, and, at times, competition.  High-contact sports are those sports in which athletes hit or collide with each other or other objects with great force (e.g., boxing, kabaddi, and mixed martial arts).  Semi-contact sports involve less contact and force (e.g., football and basketball). The higher the “contact level” of a sport, the greater is the risk of an injury. If your child is playing a contact sport, ensure that your child wears appropriate protective gear (such as helmets) and any injury is quickly recognized and adequately treated before the child resumes the sport. Even noncontact sports such as skating and dancing have risks of injuries and need protective gear (e.g., knee guards and helmets) to ensure safety. Further, if your child has a medical condition (e.g., heart disease), you need to check with your doctor about sports that your child can participate in. Finally, drinking adequate amounts of water, especially in hot and humid weather, is extremely important to prevent dehydration while playing sports."}
{"label":"Toys, Plays, and Sports","prompt": "My child wants to join a gym. What are some important aspects I should consider before he/she joins? ", "response": "There is no scientifically determined minimum age to join a gym. However, if your child wants to join, consider three important factors: 1. Overexertion can impact physical growth, as the body is still developing till around 20 years of age, hence intensity of gym use should be lesser than for an adult. 2. Gym use requires concentration; and children and adolescents may have less ability to concentrate for long periods of time. 3. The younger the child, the more important it is to supervise the child, as gyms have different kinds of equipment that can cause injuries. Based on these individual factors, you should consider if your child is ready for the gym. Resistance training (e.g., lifting of weights) is safe, as long as it is supervised and part of a properly designed training program (gradual increase of weights and use of correct equipment). Otherwise, there is a high risk of injuries. It is important to be aware of the reasons that your child wants to train and go to the gym. Too much of a concern with “bulking up” or getting a “superhero’s body” could be an indication of serious disorder about appearance or weight and may need deeper investigation."}
{"label":"Toys, Plays, and Sports","prompt": "My trainer has recommended protein powder. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the same?", "response": "Protein powder is a type of protein supple ment. Protein supplements can help to build muscle mass and strength, if your child is training or exercising adequately. They will not benefit your child, if they are taken without adequate physical activity. Secondly, as much as possible, protein should be derived from whole foods such as eggs, fish, and legumes. Supplements are processed food items and should not be used as a replacement for regular food. Overconsumption of protein  can have harmful effects on digestion and the body’s functioning, especially when it is accompanied by unhealthy or restricted diets. In conclusion, protein supplements need to be taken based on whether the child really needs it and only as an addition to a healthy and balanced diet"}
{"label":"Toys, Plays, and Sports","prompt": "My child has autism/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD)/learning difficulties. How can I adapt some of these  activities to his/her needs?", "response": "For children with physical disability, it is as important to engage in sport and play. Modified equipment (e.g., hand cycles) and modified rules may be needed for participation. Try to ensure that your child’s social group is accepting of your child by speaking to their parents about it beforehand. For children with developmental disabilities, you may have to use simpler and more attractive material at first. If your child is not interested in conventional activities, try using sensory material (e.g., dry rice, water play, and sand). Respect your child’s likes and dislikes, and do not force the child to do something, as this may be scary for the child. Do's: Do encourage your child to play, i.e., engage with people or material physically , Do allow your child to free play , Do expose your child to sports, Do play with your child. Dont's : Do not let your child be passive or watch screens all the time, Do not force your child to play in a particular way or allow inappropriate actions (e.g., hitting) , Do not pressurize your child to play at a competitive level , Do not just test your child or give instructions."}
{"label":"Early Childhood Development","prompt": "When should I start reading to my child?", "response": "Reading aloud to the young babies is an enjoyable activity and very important as it provides the building blocks for language and creative skills. Reading aloud to your baby does not have to be a serious, complex, or a time-consuming process. It can be done as a leisure when both baby and mother are relaxed and not in a hurry. It is never too late to introduce the habit of reading to the young ones. Attention of babies can be taken to the pictures in a book even before they can hold books. The ability to hear and respond to human sounds and vocal imitation starts developing before the age of 4 months. Hence, reading to the babies can begin anywhere between 4 and 6 months of age"}
{"label":"Early Childhood Development","prompt": "What are the benefits of reading aloud to my  6 months old baby?", "response": "Reading aloud to your baby will introduce the baby to new words and will help to build the mental vocabulary which will further help in creation of fluency of language. Reading together gives a signal of emotional security, attachment, love and bonding with parents.  It helps to build the imaginative and imitation skills, which help the babies to learn from new experiences in their environment and thereby helps in early brain development. When you smile, frown, blow your mouth or make different expressions and sounds, the baby learns to imitate the same which help to build social and play skills (Fig. 2). Research shows that if you start reading books to your child from 6 months of age, it will boost vocabulary and reading skills 4 years later when they start formal learning at school."}
{"label":"Early Childhood Development","prompt": "How can I positively interact with my child?", "response": "Smile at your baby and establish good eye contact often during the day in the early infancy period (Fig. 3A). When a mother makes caring verbal sounds while looking at the baby, it helps to build a good emotional attachment (Fig. 3B). Early secure attachment with mother/a main caregiver is thought to enable children to develop independence, good coping strategies, and resilience in later years. Parents must use words to praise and encourage their babies when they make cuddling and gesturing sounds (Fig. 4).  Babies develop awareness of strangers around them by the age of 6–8 months, and it peaks at 14–16 months of age. During this period, parents must provide assurance to the babies that the main family caregivers are always around to provide a secure emotional attachment.  Mothers who are engaged more to their digital devices may miss out on important time for building an emotional attachment bond with their babies which can be harmful during early brain development period. Give priority to your child than to the phone/TV/computer/laptop"}
{"label":"Early Childhood Development","prompt": "Is it important that my child interacts with family members and siblings at home?", "response": "Positive interactions between children and family members are important and serve important purpose such as learning to share, solve problems, working together as they watch, imitate, model, and interact. These skills are important for children in preschool age and will help them to perform independently and confidently at school. Interaction with siblings and family members in the early years help to create the foundation for children’s future learning for social and emotional skills. The interactions with siblings may not be pleasant always, there may be moments when the child will be upset and when parents may not be able to calm the tantrum of the child. But, each opportunity for interacting with siblings/peers should be taken as an opportunity to teach them social and emotional skills. Siblings and parents can act as the role models for teaching social and emotional skills"}
{"label":"Early Childhood Development","prompt": "Is sharing an important life skill for my child? ", "response": "If the gestures of sharing and caring are expressed openly at home by parents, children will also learn to play cooperatively with siblings/peers. A young child up to the age of 2–3 years feels that he/she is the whole center of the world and that his/her needs should be gratified and fulfilled immediately. They do not understand the concept of “waiting for their turn”. It takes a lot of time for them to understand that other people who exist around them also have needs just as they do. Sharing, helping, and cooperating are “prosocial behaviors”. Usually children <3 years cannot understand idea of sharing; sharing skills usually appear around 3.5–4 years of age [American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)]. After the age of 3.5 years, children start to develop a sense of responsiveness, and empathy and ability to share"}
{"label":"Early Childhood Development","prompt": "How can I teach sharing to my child? ", "response": " Parents can help the development of the skill of “sharing” by role modeling.  They can create scenarios using normal day-to-day activities to express kindness, empathy, and cooperation with siblings or peers. For example, parents can buy a single chocolate instead of buying a chocolate for each child. The child can be asked to share a piece each with everybody. When doing homework, a single rubber and sharpener can be kept on the study table for siblings instead of giving them individual stationery; this gives a sense of sharing and avoids creation of self-centeredness and tantrums when asked to share.   Sharing will help children to learn about negotiating, playing cooperatively with other children and to cope up with small disappointments, especially when parents are not around, for example, at school.  Children may not have many opportunities to interact with others, share, or exercise their ability to self-control especially in times of pandemics and lockdowns.   Tips to Help Develop Sharing: Involve the child in household chores. Family members sharing responsibilities at home chores work as good role modeling. Create a feeling of strong emotional attachment with your child, let them know that even if you are away at work you think about them and miss them. Do not express too much guilt for being away or try to compensate your time with materialistic gifts. Praise your child when they have expressed their feeling of empathy or cooperating with peers. Praise when they share, show them it makes the parents happy. Allow opportunity for independence in skills they have attained such as self-feeding, climbing stairs, brushing teeth, etc. Allow children to play in group activities in the residential society area with all safety precautions. Do not force your child to share/do not taunt, tease or humiliate them in front of others for not sharing. Do not give into temper tantrums, this will teach that by throwing a tantrum, they can achieve what they desire."}
{"label":"Early Childhood Development","prompt": "What social skills should be present in my child who is 14 months old?", "response": "The first experience of socialization is gained by a baby from his/her immediate environment through primary caregiver that is the mother, grandmother, other family members, and/or siblings. Social skills in children can be understood by their ability to engage in reciprocal interactions with family members, either by smiling back at them, providing good eye contact and enjoying a game like peek-a-boo and laughing.  Between 12 and 14 months, the baby requests by pointing at the object of interest. Proto-declarative pointing follows by 14–16 months of age when the child points with eye-gaze coordination to show interest and tries to get parents attention to the object by looking at them and the object to and fro (Fig. 7A).  By 18 months of age, the child can bring the object to show or give it to the parent expressing his/her interest. Around 14 months of age, the children continue to take part in games such as peek-a-boo, hide and seek, pat a cake, etc. (Fig. 7B). They can wave byebye. They can imitate and also like to help in household chores. The child’s first meaningful word may appear anytime between 8 and 14 months of age, though by 14 months a child can have two to three meaningful words in his/ her vocabulary. By 14–15 months, children also start showing interest in peers around them though they may not play cooperatively with them."}
{"label":"Early Childhood Development","prompt": "Why is socialization important for my child? How does it affect the overall development of my child?", "response": "Socialization helps to build self-confidence, improve selfimage and decrease shyness, and stage fear in children. For social skills to develop, it is important that the child learns self-regulation. Self-regulation: Early Childhood Development 10 • Self-regulation is the child’s ability to modify his/her own emotional expression, behavior, and attention for a need or a task. It starts developing around 6 months of age and teaches the child to interact with others in a socially appropriate manner. • Self-regulation goes hand-in-hand with emotional regulation where the child learns to observe self and others emotions, integrate them, and then facilitate the thought process for changing own behavior for a need. It is important that parents themselves watch their emotions and maintain a congenial cheerful environment as the babies are constantly watching them and learning from them. The social and emotional skills are basically all learnt by interacting with others. Self-regulation helps to develop the skill of “social cognition” which demonstrates the “theory of mind” teaching the children that peers/other people around them do not have the same thoughts and feelings as them. Social cognition encourages children to search for ways to get along with others keeping in mind empathy for others. Social cognition and socialization helps to build selfconfidence, improves self-image and decrease shyness, and stage fear in children. Hence, it is important that children learn self-regulation from an early age, and is an important skill during early childhood development"}
{"label":"Early Childhood Development","prompt": "Is there any role of a Speech App or Phonics App to encourage language and socialization for my 2-year-old child?", "response": "Children may not learn language from “Digital Apps” as well as they can from interacting with parents and siblings, or by being creative with toys or tools. The ability of brain to learn the “mother tongue”/local language is maximum in the first 2 years. During this time, the neurons in brain are most flexible and are able to adapt to the language, accent, rate, and rhythm of speech as well as fluency of language that the child is exposed to most. Hence, it is important that a mother/father/grandparents/ primary caregiver talk and interact with the child more rather than the child spending time with digital Apps. As the child grows and the brain matures, the neurons are less capable of reorganizing to adapt to new languages and may cause frustration to the child causing a change in behavior. Disadvantages Early introduction to digital sounds through rhymes and songs from devices may hamper with the neuronal processes in brain for picking up the first native language.  They may also delay the developmental process of speech and communication skills in children. Early introduction of digital screens and audio hampers development of the social skills during the toddler and preschool years. Swiping with fingers on the screen from an early age may hamper the development of thumb and index finger grasp, which disturbs development of fine motor skills . If children get hooked to digital screens, then they may miss out on the opportunity for developing good eye-hand  and eye-foot coordination"}
{"label":"Early Childhood Development","prompt": "Can the “Internet” applications impact  learning in children?", "response": "Based on the Montessori learning method, it may help to develop reading and spelling skills. However, language learning Apps should not be introduced to children before they have developed good social, communication, and emotional skills. These skills are best learnt in the home environment by observing and imitating family members, siblings, and peers. As mentioned above, early introduction to digital devices may interfere with the neuronal processes in brain for learning the first native language, the mother tongue.  One should wait at least till the child is 3–4 years old before introducing digital applications or digital devices for educational learning. There is evidence that during the first three years of life children find it difficult to transfer new knowledge from screen to real life. Their understanding of space, depth and distance may get disturbed by watching programs on screen. Overuse of digital screen in the early childhood years can have a negative impact on development of communication and social skills, language and attention span. Parents working from home on laptops/computer must ensure that digital devices are kept away from young children. Background sounds from digital devices and TV may interfere with children’s new learning from their environment. If parents want to introduce their children to educational programs, it should be done not before the age of 3 years and should be supervised closely by parents. Screen time should be limited to less than one hour per day for children between 3 and 5 years (AAP)"}
{"label":"Studies, Coaching, and Vocational Counseling","prompt": "When should I start sending my child to school? My child is currently 2 years old.", "response": "A.  Should it be a day-care/crèche or a formal school? It could be any location that can provide a good balance of play and academics. Methods such as Montessori schooling have shown “active learning while playing” is an effective way of engaging infants and toddlers. Structured activities/curriculum work better for 4+ year olds. A lot of parents are mistaken that the school is good for 2-yearolds. Children at 2 years of age need love, a chance to socialize with other kids, and conversation. The latter is crucial. Sending children at 2 years of age to playschool might backfire as some playschools, for not knowing what to do with these children, tend to focus on academics. Studies in developmental psychology have shown that it is harmful to push children into academics too early. Nonparental daycare is an option for a 2-year-old baby, only if parental care is not possible due to various reasonsB.   At what age, should I start reading to and writing with my child?Conversing by way of talking, reading, singing to your child should be an essential activity in first year of life. Engaging infants in this manner builds listening, memory, and vocabulary skills and introduces concepts such as numbers, letters, colors, and shapes in a fun way. Reading together when babies are as young as 4 months old increases the chances that parents continue reading to babies as they get older. Beginning early is important because the roots of language are developing in a baby’s brain even before he can talk! The more words your baby hears over time, the more words he learns. To start writing activities, the child is your best guide…take your cue from them. Usually around 18–24 months, most children get interested in holding pens or pencils and in scribbling. To introduce writing, start with an unstructured approach and expose your child to writing tools such as thick chalks or crayons, markers papers, slates, finger painting material, etc.  By 5–7 years of age, a child is able to hold a pencil correctly and form letters."}
{"label":"Studies, Coaching, and Vocational Counseling","prompt": "My 14-year-old child watches a lot of TV and when asked to stop, responds by saying that television is their only relaxation. How should l handle this?", "response": "Instead of asking the child to turn the television off, try to engage the child in an activity in which you and the child can spend some time together, such as solving a puzzle, playing a board game, doing some yoga/dance moves, or coming up with a fun story and writing it down with silly illustrations. Spend quality time with the child. Set up a physical environment at home that does not center around the TV. Try to engage the child in activities you do at home—set an example. Encourage participation in alternate activities such as sports, games, hobbies, music, etc. using age appropriate behavior modification techniques, e.g., token economy. Set a limit of 2 hours or less per day for screen viewing. Monitor the Duration and Content of TV Viewing The best way to monitor media that children use is to experience the media yourself. Test Apps and play games before the children use them. Watch what they watch. Talk about what they are seeing on their screens. You know your kids best, so you are the best judge of what they can handle. Set the viewing time by setting expectation regarding timeline and content. Try to gradually incorporate interactive shows (like quiz shows) or shows with some educational value (travel shows, nature or science documentaries, even cooking shows)."}
{"label":"Studies, Coaching, and Vocational Counseling","prompt": "My child studies a lot but is unable to do well in school tests. Is there any way I can help?", "response": "Talk to and acknowledge frequently that you are happy the child is making an effort. Try to avoid adding additional pressure regarding the marks/grades and tell them that by working together you can overcome the obstacles. Use the help of practice test books and spend some time doing mock tests with your child. Observe and try to understand the problem—is the child unable to understand the study material or does the child get nervous during the test? Knowing the issue will help you solve it more effectively. The day before the test, take a couple of hours engaging in some other activity with the child to help put their mind at ease. Approach this problem under the premise that “no child performs poorly in studies on purpose”. Every child wants all around her/him to think that she/he is the best child in the world. Therefore, if the child has difficulty in studies, there must be an underlying cause. The most common cause is lack of a “learning environment” at home, school or in the social setup that the child is living. Early detection of  the problem, early intervention, working on the child’s strengths and imparting  life-skills training are the keys to opening a stress-free path to achieving her/his  full potential in life. The “No Detention Policy” is one such hurdle which needs to be tackled. Check for sensory inputs first—“hearing and vision”. An assessment for learning disability and attention deficit is in order. Should I encourage competitive spirit in my child to always stand first in class? Every child has a different personality. Some children thrive on challenges while other children do much better when unburdened with huge pressure and unrealistic expectations. As a parent you must be an objective judge of the approach that works best for your child. However, it goes without saying that encouraging your child and telling them that they are capable of great accomplishments does wonders in building their confidence."}
{"label":"Studies, Coaching, and Vocational Counseling","prompt": "My child’s scholastic performance is poor and is not improving. Please tell me, what are “study skills” do they really work? Does punishment have any role in improvising his studies? If yes, what type of punishment is recommended? ", "response": "Study Skills Studies, Coaching, and Vocational Counseling 6 Ch-009.indd   6 Punishment For students to succeed in academics, good study skills and study techniques are very important. Study skills are the different strategies applied while learning. One must be a good listener to learn the things properly. Students think they will remember everything taught in the class and often forget. Therefore, it is important to take notes and master the art of “notes taking”. Students should learn good “time management” and plan ahead—weeks, months, and terms. Use Mind-Map, a way of organizing, visualizing, and summarizing the things. One can read loudly at home, also record it and listen to it while traveling in the school bus. Rewrite and reread until they understand the concepts properly. Discuss the subject with friends or be a tutor. By tutoring, one will understand the subject very well. Physical activity and unstructured play must be encouraged as this helps in relieving stress. Establish regular study hours. Make studying interesting and improve comprehension by introducing intelligent use of “flash cards, lists, memory strategies such as mnemonics, charts, timelines, and diagrams”. Some children may benefit from using recorders and listening to recorded information may help them to remember better. Punishment is defined as anything that attempts to decrease a behavior. Punishment makes/is aimed to learn discipline and time management. Punishment should always be at low level; however, high level of punishment will increase the fear. However, the best methods are “No punishments, but rather to teach and reward discipline”. Discipline is positive while punishment is negative. Rewards and praise always work far better than punishment. Another way is to have clear rules and expectations, and teach the consequences of breaking the rules. Punishment could be counterproductive:  Use a powerful reward. If the reward is not meaningful, behavior will not change. Rewards have been found to be much more powerful in shaping behavior than punishments.  Sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) before starting—be very specific in setting goals by describing exactly what you want the child to achieve; finalize a reward schedule for each stage toward attaining the goal with provision for continued reinforcement for staying on course.  Reward less frequently (but continue in smaller ways) as the goal is nearing achievement point. This helps to maintain the child’s training."}
{"label":"Studies, Coaching, and Vocational Counseling","prompt": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of coaching? What features should I look while selecting a coaching center for my kid? ", "response": "Advantages Coaching can make students realize the heights, they can achieve with perseverance and efforts. It may help students to reach full academic potential, to think critically, and solve problems. Coaching, especially one-on-one basis, improves individual skills and behavior. Coaching institutes may also provide career guidance. Coaching classes are useful for those students who need personal attention and a little push-up. Disadvantages However, there are disadvantages also. Child will be spoonfed, there is hardly any time for self-study and use of his own brain. Trial and error in finding the right coach to meet individual needs is waste of time. Too many tuitions leave the child with hardly any time to communicate with friends and family and this might turn him/her into an introvert.  Heavy coaching can develop stress in students due to competition.  Students from different schools with different type of syllabi may not adjust with one particular coaching center. Coaching is also an additional expenditure for parents. One has to look for such coaching institutes who can provide individual attention, one-to-one coaching, teach same syllabus as of the school and teach different learning techniques for different type of students"}
{"label":"Studies, Coaching, and Vocational Counseling","prompt": "My child is particularly good in singing. Should I send him for a coaching for this? Will it not affect his academics? ", "response": "Extracurricular activities help students to develop their skills and abilities. Evidence suggests that participating in extracurricular activities increases attendance rates, improves grades and facilitates higher educational attainment, positive social behavior, sense of belonging to school, and higher self-esteem. Some good extracurricular activities are school council, academic club, debate team, arts club, internships, cultural club, volunteer work, community service, and newspaper club. Working on strengths helps the child to excel in what she or he is good at and the resultant recognition by peers, teachers, and others improves self-esteem and overall performance of the child."}
{"label":"Studies, Coaching, and Vocational Counseling","prompt": "My child is 8 years old, he forgets very quickly, what memory booster or brain tonic should I give him? Are yoga, pranayama, and meditation useful?", "response": "There is no scientific evidence to prove the utility of any of the so-called brain tonics. Parents’ unconditioned love, support, and encouragement (PULSE) is the real brain tonic for children! Assess for learning problems, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), vision, hearing, and hypothyroidism. Assess for attention-deficit disorder (ADD)—if ADD is significantly affecting his academics—consult doctor for need for medication and study strategies. Lack of concentration is because of lack of interest, lack of sleep, diet high in carbohydrates especially sugars, excessive TV watching or any problem at home or school. • Iron deficiency needs to be corrected. • Diet should be rich in protein, iron, and omega-3. • Children should play focused games to increase concentration, e.g., jigsaw puzzles and counting backwards. Yoga Yoga is all about linking breath with motion and becoming fully present in mind and body. The practice itself is centered on concentration. Children can start practicing Yoga as soon as they start to understand instructions. Ideally kids of 4 years and above are capable of understanding instructions and follow the teacher. Advantages include better sleep, reduced anxiety and stress, improved self-esteem, and ability to focus and study. Omkar chanting increases concentration. Aasanas to increase concentration include Vrikshasana or tree pose, Taadasana, Paschimottanasana, etc. Ways to Increase Concentration Concentration games and activities such as playing chess, crossword puzzles, jigsaw puzzles, and card games such as “Memory’” and “Uno” help improve attention for words, numbers, and picture. Picture puzzles to look for things that are “wrong” in the picture or look for hard-tofind objects—also improve attention and increase concentration. Drawing within narrow track lines, playing “statue”, practicing tongue twisters, counting backward, tell a story in reverse; finding the missing in a sequence of numbers, alphabets or words of the child’s favorite rhyme, etc. are also useful strategies. Prepare a distraction-free environment at home. A power nap for 20 minutes after school or in the afternoon. Set short-term goals for better concentration; start child on the tougher activities during his high energy time and as energy levels diminish, switch to a lighter activity.Resorting to deep breathing and imagery is useful in some children.  Like any skill, concentration can be improved and made automatic. The trick is to be consistent. How many hours of sleep is appropriate. Night study or early morning study, which is better? You have not mentioned your child’s age. But, on an average, at least 9 hours of sleep is necessary for children. No particular time is ideal for studies, it is the individual’s comfort level that matters. However, if he has early morning classes, you will have to ensure that he sleeps on time to complete his sleep requirements. Inadequate sleep will not only put him to sleep in class but will also reduce his concentration and make him irritable. Online Learning Online learning is a new concept, and we all are getting used to it. You can try a few things: Use a big screen such as a desktop computer or TV instead of a tab or mobile device. Make sure the screen is kept in a common area like the hall where you can keep an eye. Screen time use apart from schooling should be restricted. Ask him to write notes and encourage him to keep his video on so that the teacher can see him. Read the topic with him before the classes to make him familiar with the subject."}
{"label":"Studies, Coaching, and Vocational Counseling","prompt": "Physical activities of my child are getting displaced because of heavy studies. Please guide", "response": "Childhood is the last chance to grow well, healthy, and strong. It is essential that they get a good supply of required nutrients. Along with that, good physical exercise is a must. Effective time management can ensure at least 45 minutes of some physical activity everyday. In fact, exercise and play will boost his concentration and ability to learn. So even though he has to spend a lot of time on studies, please make sure not to give his exercise a miss"}
{"label":"Studies, Coaching, and Vocational Counseling","prompt": "My child is very ambitious and wants to join IIT. But, I know that his capacity is not that much. Please guide.", "response": "You can take help from a good career counselor or a good psychologist to have an impartial and professional opinion after assessing the child’s strengths and limitations. That would give you an idea whether to encourage him or dissuade him. The adolescent should finally be able to decide for himself. He could take his time and try to make the grade. Do not make the mistake of telling the child that he cannot make the grade. Be supportive and teach coping skills in the meantime."}
{"label":"Studies, Coaching, and Vocational Counseling","prompt": "What is vocational counseling? When should I consult a vocational counselor? What are the principles and stages of vocational counseling?", "response": "Vocational counseling is a set of services designed to develop the skills and ability to practice a vocation in a productive way. Those born with physical or cognitive impairments are taught how to perform in the workplace taking into consideration their abilities and challenges. “Vocational guidance counseling” aims to help the individual to expand his alternative professional perspectives that are necessary in making decisions relating to the future career and profession by: Helping pupils to know themselves. Helping pupils to make a right choice. Helping pupils to prepare themselves for entry into the careers of their choice. Helping pupils to get suitable jobs in their chosen field. Helping pupils according to their vocational assets and liabilities. Helping pupils to be familiar with vocational implications of different subjects to be studied in the secondary school. Helping pupils to be familiar with occupations and their requirements. The principles of vocational counseling are all-round development of the individual, considering human uniqueness and it should be objective and must be based on facts. Three stages of vocational guidance are “primary school stage”, “secondary school stage”, and “college stage”. Primary school stage is not appropriate stage for career guidance. Hence, vocational guidance program is not given for children at this level. At secondary school stage, child has already reached adolescence stage and is capable of taking decision about his future. So, it is the right and appropriate stage to guide them for their career. At the “college stage”, one should assist students to relate their studies with the vocations that would help them at the end of their college career"}
{"label":"Traveling with a Child","prompt": "What precautions can we (parents) and our older kids take regarding food, drinking water, and hygiene while traveling?", "response": " You should carry plenty of boiled and cooled water procured from a safe source with intact seal. It is better to avoid ice cubes of unknown source. Favorite homemade snacks are desirable. Use only safe, hot, and hygienic food. For older kids try to keep a familiar food routine. Washing hands frequently with soap and water or use sanitizers, if handwashing facilities are not available. Food should be steaming hot, freshly cooked and it is best to be cautious not to consume reheated food. At buffet, one should avoid raw food, cut and kept salads or fruits. It should be a big NO to street foods. We should always have snacks available for kids, as hunger makes a kid cranky and inconsolable."}
{"label":"Traveling with a Child","prompt": "What emergency medicines and articles we should carry in our kit to tide over situations such as diarrhea, vomiting, and fever?", "response": "We should carry paracetamol as drops and syrups 125 mg/5 mL and 250 mg/5 mL  as well as paracetamol tablets 500 mg for older kids. Ibuprofen suspension and tablets for older children are also desirable to be carried. Domperidone/Ondansetron syrup and tablets for nausea and vomiting A digital thermometer in working condition An itching lotion, antiseptic lotion, and sunscreen lotion. Insect repellents and bandAids. Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) powder and sachets.It is best not to carry antibiotics unless your child is already on it. Antidiarrheal medicines are best avoided. You can take care of diarrhea by controlling food intake, proper diet, rehydration with ORS, and zinc supplements. Diarrhea with blood will need antibiotics; consult your doctor. Usual drugs your child may be taking as prescribed by your pediatrician should be carried."}
{"label":"Traveling with a Child","prompt": "How can we make travel with children safe and at the same time create an environment of fun for them?", "response": "Your child’s vaccination schedule should be up-to-date, any missing vaccines should be done at least 72 hours before travel. Family travel insurance papers should be in place. Always try to keep kids close to adults in the family. You should have a recovery plan in an unforeseen situation of a lost child. Try and keep children away from wild animals. Older children should be involved in planning travel and going over an outline of the trip and recording of memories in notebook. Checking-in at airports, going through security, buying snacks and drinks, and boarding the plane can be fun for kids when they have prior information. Surprise your child with a new toy, bring some school supplies, and download music or audio books. Kids should be aware that things may go wrong in unforeseen situations; prepare them. Try to pre-book everything possible—besides tickets and hotel, private and public transportation, sightseeing tours, private guides, tickets for museums, theme parks, and other areas. Explain the trip to children. Some games such as a magnetic game, pack of cards, and a camera can keep kids occupied and happy. Avoid screen time and indulge in “nature” study. Do not make a very hasty schedule, leave plenty of time for adjustment. A flexible plan causes less stress for you and your family and leads to a happier trip overall. We must remember that when kids are uncomfortable, they are not happy, and if there are too many new things going on kids may become irritable or cranky."}
{"label":"Traveling with a Child","prompt": "I am a new mom, and am traveling  with my baby for the first time,  what are your advice?", "response": "You should exclusively breastfeed your baby at least up to 6 months of age (privacy may be an issue especially in public places). Avoid bottle-feeds, these may cause infections. Please ensure that you have sufficient stock of nappies and wipes and some essential medicines as may be needed. You need to pack a change of clothes for yourself. It is important to select a suitable seat for yourself and baby. Aisle seat is preferable. Use of a travel neck pillow and a nursing pillow is helpful. If your baby cries, the chances of which are high, the most important thing is not to worry. You may try to feed the baby or administer paracetamol drops or anticolic medicine as per need. Do not feel guilty for other passengers, because they would understand what traveling alone with a baby means. If in a flight, feed can be prepared with assistance from the flight attendant.  A bassinet can be requested for infants up to 18 months of age or else a separate seat is desirable with seat belts for older children. Diaper change table can be used in the lavatory and immediate disposal of the diaper in closed bags. If your child is crying, he may be having an earache, you need not make him feel guilty, help him to calm, give medicine for pain if needed."}
{"label":"Traveling with a Child","prompt": "What are the risks involved while traveling with my child both in India and abroad?", "response": "The common risk factors involved in traveling are sickness, accidents, antisocial elements, thieves, loss of belonging, and missing of essential documents. Local travel by trains and buses may involve overcrowding. Keep your child close to you at all time. Beware of pick-pockets. Food and water hygiene to be followed diligently. Prevent coughs and colds by wearing masks. To prevent mosquito menace, carry appropriate repellents. Travel insurance plan is a must."}
{"label":"Traveling with a Child","prompt": "What advice would you give to my kids regarding motion sickness, air pressure changes, and jet lag during international travel?", "response": "Your child should avoid being empty stomach during travel. Ask them to focus on objects straight ahead which may help. Prefer to get window seats, antinausea medication like domperidone may help. For jet lag, you may try to plan travel during sleeping hours of the child if your child sleeps well on planes. Some families prefer flying during the day to arrive at night and then get a full night’s sleep at the destination or prefer to change the sleep habits 3 days before, especially in long zone air travel. One can have a “Family Jet Lag Party” to turn the dreaded effects of jet lag into a family fun activity on arrival. There should be plenty of fresh air and light in the new environment to help kids settle in faster. For pressure, changes give something to eat or chew-like chewing gum during take-offs and landing. Children should be told to respect local customs and laws. Dress code as appropriate and they should be made aware of conduct in public places. Take this opportunity to go over your expectations for their behavior throughout the trip. Detail on how they should act on planes, hotels, and on tours. Cracking a joke around security checks can be a hazardous experience."}
{"label":"Traveling with a Child","prompt": "I prefer to travel light with my baby yet would not like to miss out on any important items I may need for him. Please give me some advice.", "response": "Yes, you should carry sufficient stock of milk, packed food, and water. Babies and older kids should be dressed appropriately to the climate conditions. Nappies, wipes, toys, paracetamol drops, and  medicines for colic pain should be packed. An extra bit of baggage is better than feeling sorry at the time of need. Sometimes borrowing or renting items at a destination place is a great way to travel light"}
{"label":"Traveling with a Child","prompt": "I run a foster care center. What are your points of advice for traveling with a child with special needs—asthma, convulsions, mentally and physically challenged kids, and children with congenital heart disease?", "response": "My first advice for these children with special needs is to handle them with utmost care; it can be scary for them in crowded places. Take appropriate inhalers and spacers for children with asthma, anticonvulsant that a child may be on, in addition emergency drugs that may be needed, rectal midazolam nasal spray, and cardiac drugs as appropriately advised by pediatrician. Mentally challenged kids can be difficult to handle from seating in one place; we can try taking rear end seats. Take extra care with kids with sickle cell disease as they may need oxygen at high altitudes. We should inform airlines of special situations ahead. Children with type 1 diabetes may need extra care during long zone travels."}
{"label":"Traveling with a Child","prompt": "Kindly guide how to travel safe during pregnancy.", "response": "The best option is to avoid travel during pregnancy. If essential, it is safe to travel by air before 36 weeks of pregnancy. Enough time should be allowed so that there is no rush during check-in and in the flight itself. You should take all the prescribed medicines with you. Try to have a seat with good leg space; you should walk up and down the aisle every 2–3 hours on long flights to avoid the possibility of clots in the veins. If you wish to undertake road travel, you should avoid bumpy roads, travel at lesser speed, take frequent stops, and hydrate yourself with fluids and proper light meals. If there is an option between rail and road journeys, perhaps the rail route is better provided the connectivity of your stations permit"}
{"label":"Traveling with a Child","prompt": "What extra precautions do you advice for travel during  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic?", "response": "You should travel with children only if it is a must during a pandemic. Traveling in your own vehicle is the safest option to reduce exposure to outsiders. Let older children understand details of travel for themselves. We need strollers for infants and toddlers, check if they can be taken via security checks. Book a separate seat for a child for his comfort, seat belts must be appropriately fastened. Pack some toys, crayons, reading books (light ones), and earphones for listening to music. In road travel by car have a break every 2 hours, use car seats on the rear, and keep young ones occupied when awake—by using toys, storytelling, and sing along ideas. We should never leave a child alone anytime, especially in a closed car. We should equip the older child with emergency contact details. Make them aware of proper hand hygiene, sanitization, physical distancing, and wearing masks. Children should be made aware of covering their face while coughing and sneezing. Follow quarantine rules of different cities and countries as appropriate. Carry safe water, healthy snacks, and hand wipes. Beware of the possibility of abduction, abuse, goons in certain areas. Children should be told to say a strict NO to strangers—If by mistake be alone/lost, ask them to take help from uniformed police."}
